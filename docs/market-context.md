# Market Context

Merit Energy was developed in response to a growing structural problem in the home energy market.

Rising electricity prices, increasing adoption of electric vehicles, and the complexity of modern tariffs create a gap between what users *pay* and what they *could save* with smarter energy usage.

Most households:
- do not understand how their energy is consumed,
- lack real-time insight into cost drivers,
- and cannot easily optimise usage across appliances, heating, and EV charging.

This project explores how AI-driven optimisation and user-centric design could transform home energy management from a passive utility into an active, intelligent system.

The goal is not only cost reduction, but behavioural change — empowering users to make informed, sustainable decisions without cognitive overload.
