# My Role in Merit Energy

In this project, I acted as a product lead and co-founder, responsible for shaping the concept from an initial idea into a structured digital product.

My key responsibilities included:

- Defining the product vision and value proposition  
- Translating user problems into functional requirements  
- Designing the product structure and feature logic  
- Leading early-stage validation through user interviews and feedback  
- Coordinating between technical, business, and user-experience perspectives  
- Developing the strategic narrative for pitching and stakeholder communication  

Rather than focusing only on “what to build”, my role centred on *why* the product should exist, *for whom*, and *how* it should create long-term value.

This required combining:
- analytical thinking (market structure, user behaviour, constraints),
- product intuition (user needs, friction points, adoption barriers),
- and strategic framing (positioning, differentiation, future growth paths).

The project reflects my ability to operate in ambiguity, structure complex problems, and lead digital products from concept to execution.
