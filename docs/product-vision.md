# Product Vision

Merit Energy exists to turn home energy from a passive cost into an intelligent, user-controlled system.

Today, households face rising electricity prices, complex tariffs, and increasing energy demands from EVs and smart devices.  
Most people do not understand where their energy goes, when it is cheapest, or how their behaviour affects cost and carbon impact.

The result is stress, inefficiency, and wasted money.

Merit Energy is designed to solve this by becoming a *personal energy intelligence layer* for the home.

It is built for:
- EV owners and energy-conscious households,
- people who care about cost and sustainability,
- but do not want to become energy experts.

The product aims to:

- make energy usage visible and understandable,
- translate complex tariff structures into simple actions,
- guide users towards better decisions without cognitive overload,
- and gradually change behaviour through small, actionable nudges.

Merit Energy is not just a dashboard.

It is a decision companion that:
- observes usage patterns,
- predicts outcomes,
- and recommends the best next action in context.

Over time, the product should evolve from:
> “showing what happened”  
to  
> “advising what to do”  
to  
> “automatically optimising energy in the background”.

The long-term vision is a home that:

- charges the car at the cheapest and cleanest times,
- adapts heating and appliances intelligently,
- reduces waste without user micromanagement,
- and makes sustainable behaviour the default.

Merit Energy aims to become the operating system for smarter, calmer, and more efficient home energy.
